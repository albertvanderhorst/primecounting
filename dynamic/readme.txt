The programs in this directory are so fast that they need
a Forth with a huge memory space, or larger.
lina8G in this directory caters to this, but it requires a library
that in /usr/lib which will be present if you installed a
regular lina version 5.3 or higher.

It doesn't make sense to run them on a 32 bit system with a
skimpy memory space.
